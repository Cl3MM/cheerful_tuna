Dear Mr <%= @name %>,


The updated Conto Energia 5 in Italy requires every systems/consortia such as
CERES, to account for the number of modules put on the Italian market by its
members.

In order to comply with this requirement, CERES is gathering data from every
member that export / distribute solar panels in Italy.

If you are exporting or distributing modules in Italy, you have to provide
CERES with the following data:
- consolidated number of modules you put on the market between the 1st of
  July, 2012 and the 31rd of August, 2012.
- the corresponding list of module's serial number for that period.

The data will be consolidated and transmitted to the GSE as required by the new
Italian regulation.  Moreover, CERES will also require these figures at the end
of December for the period ranging from the 01/09/2012 to the 31/12/2012.

Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any question,


Best regards,
