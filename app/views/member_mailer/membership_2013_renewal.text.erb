Customers are now acutely aware of end-of-life issues and this has become
a selling point for our industry. Using the CERES system for end-of-life
photovoltaic modules you put on the market is essential to protect your
brand image and your production cost.

*The end of 2012 has brought many regulation changes for end-of-life
photovoltaic modules. The recast of WEEE directive now includes
photovoltaic modules. European Union member states have now until
February 14th to transpose these new regulations into national law*.

Large markets, such as Italy, have already imposed *new requirements to
deal with end-of-life photovoltaic modules*. The Czech Republic is also
expected to impose new regulations for end-of-life photovoltaic modules by
this summer. You can stay up to date with national regulations by
visiting our website:
http://www.ceres-recycle.org/legal-obligations/country-specifications

In order to adapt to those new regulations, CERES is evolving. We have
lowered the membership Fee to a one-time 500 Euros flat-fee that covers
all EU countries.  Additionally there now is a Contribution Fee of
1 Eur per ton sold during the previous year. We believe that this new
calculation method will allow a fairest repartition of the cost over our
members while allowing us to ensure a full compliance with the new
obligations. At the same time, we’ve ensured that *CERES continues to be
the most competitive pan-European take-back system*.
